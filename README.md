## Configuration

The application can be customized by modifying the `config.js` file. Here are the key configuration options:

- **`displayFormat`**: Determines the format in which search results are displayed. Options are:
  - `"cards"`: Results are displayed as cards.
  - `"table"`: Results are displayed in a table format.

- **`categories`**: An array of objects, each representing a data source category. Each category object contains the following properties:
  - **`name`**: The name of the category (e.g., "Samples", "Equipment").
  - **`dataSource`**: The data source for the category, imported from `data.js`.
  - **`fields`**: An array of fields to display for each item in the category.
  - **`maxResults`**: The maximum number of results to display for the category.
  - **`maxSuggestions`**: The maximum number of suggestions to display for the category.
  - **`order`**: The order in which the category should appear in the results. Lower numbers appear first. A value of `-1` means the order is ignored, and results are sorted by score.
  - **`icon`**: The FontAwesome icon class for the category.
  - **`showMoreUrl`**: The URL for the "Show More" button, which will append the search query as a parameter.
  - **`detailsUrl`**: The base URL for the details page, which will append the item ID.
  - **`suggestionLabel`**: The format for suggestion labels, using placeholders like `${id}` and `${name}`.

- **`popularSearches`**: An object containing predefined frequent searches for each category. Each key corresponds to a category name, and the value is an array of search terms.

Example configuration:
```javascript
const config = {
  displayFormat: "cards",
  categories: [
    {
      name: "Samples",
      dataSource: dataSources.Samples,
      fields: ["id", "name", "equipment"],
      maxResults: 3,
      maxSuggestions: 3,
      order: 1,
      icon: "fas fa-vial",
      showMoreUrl: "/samples",
      detailsUrl: "/sample-details",
      suggestionLabel: "${id} - ${name}"
    },
    {
      name: "Equipment",
      dataSource: dataSources.Equipment,
      fields: ["id", "name", "customer"],
      maxResults: 5,
      maxSuggestions: 5,
      order: 2,
      icon: "fas fa-microscope",
      showMoreUrl: "/equipment",
      detailsUrl: "/equipment-details",
      suggestionLabel: "${name} (${id})"
    }
  ]
};

const popularSearches = {
  Samples: ["SMP-56789", "SMP-43221", "SMP-90877"],
  Equipment: ["EQP-1023", "EQP-2045", "EQP-3078"]
};
```

## Data Sources

The `data.js` file contains the sample data used in this application. You can replace this with your own data sources. Each data source is an array of objects with fields that can be searched and displayed.

Example data structure:
```javascript
const dataSources = {
  Samples: [
    { id: "SMP-56789", name: "Sample 1", equipment: "EQP-1023" },
    { id: "SMP-43221", name: "Sample 2", equipment: "EQP-2045" }
  ],
  Equipment: [
    { id: "EQP-1023", name: "Spectrometer X-300", customer: "LabTech Solutions" },
    { id: "EQP-2045", name: "Microscope UltraZoom", customer: "LabTech Solutions" }
  ]
};
```

## Templates

The application uses two templates for displaying search results:

### 1. **Card Template (`cardTemplate.js`)**
   - Displays results in a card format.
   - Each card contains the fields specified in the configuration.
   - The `id` field acts as a hyperlink to the details page.

### 2. **Table Template (`tableTemplate.js`)**
   - Displays results in a table format.
   - Each row corresponds to an item, and columns represent the fields specified in the configuration.
   - The `id` field acts as a hyperlink to the details page.
